# Steps taken to retrieve the final line chart:
- SQL queries to extract both city level data and global data from the Udacity portal and export to CSV

- Create a line chart that compares the moving averages of both the city level and global
temperatures
- Make at least four observations about the similarities and differences in the trends between the world average temeprature with the local average temperature.
